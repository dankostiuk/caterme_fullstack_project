<h1>CaterMe</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

A meal order tracking web app consisting of an Angular2-based front-end communicating with a Java backend.

<h2>Background</h2>

A friend of mine makes a living by driving around a catering truck. Rather than solely relying on his morning stock up of pizza slices, chips and pastries, he often carries out custom meal deliveries for his customers. This is done by initially meeting up with the customer at their place of work to take down their order information. Next, the driver must go out and purchase their order for an agreed upon time. All of this is tracked on pen and paper and uses up a lot of unnecessary driving time. It's pretty obvious that a lot of effort can be saved if customers could place their orders ahead of time online to be tracked and acknowledged by the driver throughout his busy day. After some discussion over a few drinks I decided I'd take a crack at putting everything I've learned to date to create such a system to help him out.

<h2>Why am I making it?</h2>

<p>Currently employed as a Backend Developer, one my previous jobs involved myself contributing to a fullstack implementation of a web app using AngularJS and Java. While I'm happy solely focusing on the daily duties of a Backend Developer, I miss being able to create something entirely from scratch. Furthermore, I'm constantly hearing about all the advances in the frontend world and I know that if I ever wanted to be a FullStack Developer again, I better keep up with what's trending. Already having exposure to AngularJS from my previous job and reading a lot about its newer version, I decided to choose Angular2 as my frontend framework. Now that I had my frontend framework it was time to decide on what to use as my backend. I realize fullstack implementations can be done in pure JavaScript using Node instead of traditional OOP languages such as Java. However for the sake of showcasing my knowledge of Java as a backend language, I decided to stay loyal and stick with Java.
